One main difference between human learning and neural network leanring, is that humans encounter a whole stream of learning problems over their entire lifetime.
Lifelong learning for a deep neural network is similar to how human is learning in throughout their life: instead of learning one single tasks, lifelong learning makes a learner face a whole stream of learning tasks, which enables them to transfer knowledge across these tasks.
