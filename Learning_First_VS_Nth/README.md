One main difference between human learning and neural network learning, is that unlike networks trained for one specific tasks, humans encounter a whole stream of learning problems over their entire lifetime. When humans encounter a new thing to learn, they could easily transfer information and experiences that stem from other related tasks and utilize them to assist their new learning task. To realize such transfer of knowledge in the machine learning, a fr
