Lifelong learning for a deep neural network is similar to how human is learning in throughou
 making a learner faces a whole stream of learning tasks, which enables them to transfer know
It is shown that across the board, lifelong learning approaches generalize consistently more accurately from less training data, by their ability to transfer knowledge across learning tasks.
