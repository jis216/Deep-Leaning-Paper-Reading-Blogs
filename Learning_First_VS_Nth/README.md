# Learning the First Thing vs. the N-th Thing

One main difference between human learning and neural network learning, is that unlike networks trained for one specific tasks, humans encounter a whole stream of learning problems over their entire lifetime. 
When faced with a new thing to learn, humans can usually exploit an enormous amount of training data and experiences that stem from other related learning tasks.

Lifelong learning for a deep neural network is similar to how human is learning in throughout their life: instead of learning one single tasks, lifelong learning makes a learner face a whole stream of learning tasks, which enables them to transfer knowledge across these tasks.
