One main difference between human learning and neural network learning, is that unlike networks trained for one specific tasks, humans encounter a whole stream of learning problems over their entire lifetime. When humans encounter a new thing to learn, they could easily transfer information and experiences that stem from other related tasks and utilize them to assist their new learning task. 

To realize such kind of knowledge transfer in the learning process of machine, the *lifelong learning framework* is created. In this framework, it is assumed that a learner faces a whole collection of learning problems over its entire lifetime. This framework is based
